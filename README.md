# Saturation-Profile-and-Saturation-History
In this project, I set up a high-pressure high-temperature core flooding device equipped with an in-situ dual-energy X-ray saturation profile monitoring system to conduct pilot studies with live crude oil samples. In these experiments, formation water and associated gas were injected alternatively into six composite carbonate core samples arranged in series, each extracted from a different flow unit. In addition to the petroleum engineering aspect of this project, I also developed a software for the calculation of saturation history and saturation profile employing the Beer-Lambert law and performing a bicubic spline interpolation on the low and high energy X-ray measurements of core samples.
